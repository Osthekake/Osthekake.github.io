				The point of this portfolio is to collect and showcase my skills outside of work experience.</p>

				<p class="lead">Ludum Dare is a 48 hour game jam that happens globally, three times a year. Participants have to create an entire game, 
				by themselves in 48 hours. I like to try to participate, but I have drifted more towards the 72 hour variant where you 
					are allowed to work in teams over the years.</p>

						<strong>Theme: 10 seconds</strong>
						<p>My first ever Ludum Dare entry, for LD-27. Requires that you download a jar and run locally. <br/>
							You must have java installed in order to play. The game is created entirely from scratch by me, 
							using nothing but the Java SDK.
							The idea for this game was pretty good, and I plan to recreate it in a different form.
							The link on the ludum dare site is broken. Use <a href="http://bit.ly/2xtHohy">this link</a> to download the jar if you want to play.

						<strong>Theme: You only get one</strong>
						<p>My second Ludum Dare entry, for LD-28. Requires that you download a jar and run locally. <br/>
							You must have java installed in order to play. The game is made using some of the code from the previous game.
							I discovered that platform mechanics are more difficult than you would think.

						<strong>Theme: Beneath the surface</strong>
						<p>My first collaborative Ludum Dare entry, for LD-29. Programming, concept, rough story and art by me.
							Use the keyboard arrows to move, and enter to select things. This is a small puzzle-adventure game, 
							made with html and javascript. Images are rendered to canvas, and the game is very poorly optimized. 
							It might cause your browser to use a lot of cpu.

						<h3><a href="http://osthekake.github.io/LD30/">Connected Worlds</a></h3>
						<strong>Theme: Connected Worlds</strong>
						<p>Second collaborative entry for LD-30. Features a faux browser where you as the player will click around the faux internet to gather 
							clues for a murder investigation. Not particularly self-explainatory. It is possible to gather all the clues, and win,
							but I forgot how. <br/>
							Uses the same kind of technology as the previous one, but doesn't have the same intensive render-loop.<br/>
							The game placed #77 in the innovation (jam) category.

						<h3><a href="http://osthekake.github.io/LD35/">Werewolf</a></h3>
						<strong>Theme: Shapeshifters</strong>
						<p>After a couple of skipped Ludum Dares, and a few where I tried to participate, but didn't deliver, I made this for LD-35.
							The goal of this management/puzzle game is to eat or transform all the villagers. The various icons have meansings that 
							are not at all self-explainatory, and maybe even misleading. There is some help to be had if you click along the top.<br/>
							This is more or less a standard web-application.

						<strong>Theme: Out of Space</strong>
						<p>
							Using <a href="https://excaliburjs.com/">excalibur.js</a>, I created this game about moving furniture using rocket technology.
							I was not happy with the UX here, and I didn't have the time to make a story or make the game the way I wanted. There is no strong tie-in with the theme.
							I wasted a lot of my time on trying to get click events working properly. Perhaps the framework was not as mature as one might wish.

						<h3><a href="http://osthekake.github.io/HexGame/main">Rotating hexes game</a></h4>
						<p>This was made after I heard an idea someone had for a game with hexes and some sort of math problems. 
							I thought of a better idea in my humble opinion, and this is the result of that. Created with html and javascript. 
							Graphics are rendered on canvas, and animations are timed and programmed by hand.

							This is a home-made graphics engine I made to experiment with shaders in GLSL. Originally I planned to make a northern 
							lights-shader, but in the end I got distracted, and made a bunch of other shaders. <br/>
							Needs java installed to run. Demo shows a globe with night- and day-sides and a movable light source.
